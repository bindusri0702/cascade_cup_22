# cascade_cup_22
This code is submitted as part of the cascade cup 2022 challenge conducted by shadowfax in Kaggle.

The goal of this project is to predict rider-driven cancellation in advance.

The link to the competetion is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cascade-cup-22)

The notebook uses Machine leraning models like LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, GaussianNB, SVC to classify whether rider will cancel the ride or not given order time, allot time, accept time, distance between rider's location and pickup location, distance between pickup location and delivery location and many other factors.
